name: update-git-repos
description: Use when the user asks to update all their git repos, pull main on all repos, sync repos from origin, refresh local clones, or run `git pull` across a known set of repos. Pulls every repo listed in ~/.config/wild-horses/wrangle/repos.json from origin/<branch> via the bundled CLI. Also handles bootstrapping that config (auto-discovery under a root directory, plus manual add/remove).

# update-git-repos

Pull every repo in the config from `origin/<branch>` in one shot. When a working tree is dirty, `pull-all` applies the configured default action — `ask` (the default), `skip`, or `stash` — resolved per-repo then globally; with `ask` it prompts you per repo to pick stash-pull or skip.

## Quick reference

- **Config:** `~/.config/wild-horses/wrangle/repos.json` — `{"default_dirty_action": "ask|skip|stash", "repos": [{"path": "...", "branch": "main", "dirty_action": "ask|skip|stash"}, ...]}`. Both action keys are optional; `default_dirty_action` defaults to `ask`, and a per-repo `dirty_action` overrides it. **Resolution:** per-repo `dirty_action` → top-level `default_dirty_action` → `ask`.
- **CLI:** `python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/update_repos_cli.py" <subcommand>`
- **Subcommands:** `bootstrap-discover --root DIR`, `add PATH [--branch B]`, `remove PATH`, `set-action <ask|skip|stash|inherit> [--repo PATH]`, `list`, `pull-all`, `pull-one PATH [--stash]`
- **Every subcommand prints JSON on stdout.** Parse it; do not screen-scrape.
- **Exit codes:** 0 means the command itself succeeded (per-repo errors live inside the JSON's `status` field); non-zero means the command itself failed (bad path, corrupt config, etc).

## Procedure

Follow the steps in order. Skip step 2 if the config already has repos.

### 1. Check the config

Run `list`. If `repos` is non-empty, go straight to step 3. If `repos` is empty, go to step 2.

### 2. Bootstrap (only when config empty)

Ask the user for a root directory to scan (suggest `~/dev` or `~` as starting points; honor whatever they say). Run:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/update_repos_cli.py" bootstrap-discover --root <DIR>
```

The output is a JSON array of `{path, default_branch, in_config}` for every `.git` found under `DIR` (does not descend into a found repo, skips `node_modules`/`.venv`/etc).

Show the user the list. Ask which repos to include — use AskUserQuestion with multiSelect when there are ≤ 4 candidates; otherwise show the list inline and ask "all of them?" / "exclude any?".

For each chosen repo, call:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/update_repos_cli.py" add <PATH>
```

Omit `--branch` unless the user wants a non-default branch — the CLI auto-detects from `origin/HEAD`.

Then continue to step 3.

### 3. Pull everything

Run:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/update_repos_cli.py" pull-all
```

The CLI inspects every repo, pulls the clean+on-branch ones with `git pull --ff-only`, and applies each dirty repo's configured action inline (`stash` does a stash-pull-pop, `skip` leaves it untouched, `ask` defers to step 4); the remaining repos are reported without mutation. The output is `{"results": [...], "up_to_date": N}`. **`up_to_date` is the count of already-current repos — they are deliberately omitted from `results` to save tokens; just report the number in step 5.** Parse the `results` array for everything else. Each entry has a `status` field:

| `status`                   | meaning                                                                                                                                                                        | next action                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pulled`                   | fast-forward succeeded; carries a `stat` (git `--shortstat`) when the diff is non-empty                                                                                        | report in step 5 — show the `stat`                                                                 |
| `up-to-date`               | already current — **never appears in `results`**; surfaced only as the top-level `up_to_date` count                                                                            | render the `up_to_date` count as the one-line `Up to date (no change): N repos` summary in step 5  |
| `dirty`                    | working tree has tracked-file changes; effective action is `ask`, so not pulled                                                                                                | step 4 (prompt)                                                                                    |
| `skipped`                  | working tree was dirty and the effective action is `skip`; carries `reason: "dirty"`, repo untouched, no prompt                                                                | report under "Skipped:" in step 5                                                                  |
| `wrong-branch`             | current branch ≠ configured branch; not pulled                                                                                                                                 | report and skip (don't touch — user may be mid-work on a feature branch)                           |
| `missing`                  | path doesn't exist anymore                                                                                                                                                     | report; offer to `remove`                                                                          |
| `not-a-repo`               | path exists but isn't a git repo                                                                                                                                               | report; offer to `remove`                                                                          |
| `pull-failed`              | `git pull --ff-only` failed (diverged history, no `origin`, network error, or a remote that needed credentials — prompts are disabled, so auth fails fast instead of hanging)  | report with the `error` field                                                                      |
| `stash-failed`             | the configured `stash` action's `git stash push` failed before any pull; repo left untouched; carries `error`                                                                  | report with the `error` field                                                                      |
| `pulled-with-pop-conflict` | the configured `stash` action fast-forwarded but `git stash pop` hit a merge conflict; conflict markers are now in the working tree and the stash is gone; carries `pop_error` | tell the user clearly and surface `pop_error` so they know what to resolve                         |
| `timed-out`                | `git pull` exceeded the timeout (slow/unreachable remote); the pull was killed, repo left untouched                                                                            | report with the `error` field; suggest checking the remote/network, or raise `WRANGLE_GIT_TIMEOUT` |

### 4. Handle dirty repos (only those with `status: dirty`)

A repo only comes back `dirty` when its effective action is `ask` — `skip` repos already came back `skipped`, and `stash` repos were already pulled inline. So for each `dirty` repo, ask the user via AskUserQuestion: **"Stash & pull"** or **"Skip"**.

To stop being asked, the user can store a default with `set-action`:

```bash
# Always skip dirty repos from now on:
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/update_repos_cli.py" set-action skip
# Always stash-pull-pop dirty repos from now on:
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/update_repos_cli.py" set-action stash
# Per-repo override (wins over the global default):
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/update_repos_cli.py" set-action stash --repo /Users/paul/dev/foo
# Clear a per-repo override (fall back to the global default):
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/update_repos_cli.py" set-action inherit --repo /Users/paul/dev/foo
# Go back to being asked each time:
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/update_repos_cli.py" set-action ask
```

When the user says things like "always skip dirty repos", "stash repo X by default", or "go back to asking", call `set-action` accordingly before (or after) the pull.

For "Stash & pull":

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/update_repos_cli.py" pull-one <PATH> --stash
```

The result `status` is one of:

- `pulled` / `up-to-date` — stash popped cleanly. Report in step 5.
- `pulled-with-pop-conflict` — fast-forward succeeded but `stash pop` hit a merge conflict. **The conflict markers are in the working tree now; the stash is gone.** Tell the user clearly and surface `pop_error` so they know what to resolve.
- `stash-failed` / `pull-failed` — surface the `error` field; the working tree is unchanged.

### 5. Summary

Keep it terse — fewer tokens is better. **Only list repos that need the user's attention**: those that were `pulled` (so they see what changed) and those with a problem (`skipped`, `wrong-branch`, `dirty`, errors). **Render the `up_to_date` count as a single line** — `Up to date (no change): N repos` (the CLI already excluded those repos from `results`, so there are no paths to enumerate). If a whole group is empty, omit its header entirely.

For each `pulled` repo, append its `stat` field verbatim after the path; if a `pulled` entry has no `stat` (a commit with no textual diff), just show the path. Use simple ASCII prefixes (no emoji unless the user opted in).

```text
Pulled:
  + /Users/paul/dev/foo (main): 5 files changed, 120 insertions(+), 30 deletions(-)
  + /Users/paul/dev/bar (master): 2 files changed, 8 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)

Up to date (no change): 18 repos

Skipped:
  ! /Users/paul/dev/qux (dirty)
  ! /Users/paul/dev/quux (wrong-branch: on feature, expected main)

Errors:
  x /Users/paul/dev/old (missing) — suggest `remove`
  x /Users/paul/dev/slow (timed-out) — check the remote/network
```

When everything was already current and nothing else happened, the entire summary is just `Up to date (no change): N repos` — nothing more.

## Common mistakes

- **Don't run raw `git pull` in a loop.** The CLI sequences status-check → conditional pull with `--ff-only` per repo and reports a structured outcome. Hand-rolled loops bypass dirty-tree safety and lose the JSON contract step 4 depends on.
- **Don't override the configured dirty action with a prompt.** Honor the resolved action: `skip` repos come back `skipped` (just report them), `stash` repos are already pulled, and you only prompt for repos that come back `dirty` (effective action `ask`). Never auto-stash a repo whose effective action is `ask`, and never re-prompt for one whose stored action is `skip`/`stash`.
- **Don't try to "fix" `wrong-branch` repos by checking out the configured branch.** The user may be intentionally on a feature branch. Report it and move on.
- **Don't skip the empty-config case.** `pull-all` returns `{"empty": true, ...}` (exit 0) when the config has no repos — handle that by routing into step 2, not by treating it as an error.
- **Don't include `node_modules` or build dirs in `bootstrap-discover` results manually.** The CLI already skips them; if you see surprising paths, report them so we can extend the skip list, don't filter on the agent side.
- **Don't pass `--branch` to `add` unless the user asked for a non-default branch.** The CLI's auto-detection from `origin/HEAD` is what makes the config self-maintaining.
